# Vote++

This is a Lua module for Enemy Territory - Wolfenstein server introducing extended voting functionality and providing an easy way to define new commands.

## Usage

1. Put `vote++.lua` in `legacy` folder.
2. Create an empty `vote++.config.lua` file or put individual files in `legacy/vote++` folder,
3. Append `vote++.lua` to `lua_modules` cvar.

> Client interface does not reflect the casted vote, or it can incorrectly render as already casted without that being actually the case. You can fix that in ETPro by switching to [patched qagame](https://klva.cz/s/qagame-gentity-hack.md). It is not mandatory, the votes are casted anyway; it's only the yellow popup that's wrong.

## Configuration

All the configuration belongs to `vote++.config.lua` or `legacy/vote++` folder.

Apart from defining commands, you can define any ET callback (like `et_RunFrame`) and use any API (`et.*` and stdlib).

### Defining vote commands

~~~lua
Vote:new("nohw")
    :description("Disable heavy weapons")
    :pass("exec nohw.cfg")
~~~

This command can be executed as: `callvote nohw`, `ref nohw` (in server console or as an authenticated referee).

- `Vote:new(string)`: command name, can be defined as:
    - `string`
    - `string <arg1> <arg2>`

The module automatically validates number of passed arguments and prints a help message when not enough of them is given.  There's a special reserved argument `<player>`, which always resolves to a slot number. Caller can use part of name instead. When using string as argument to callback functions (see below), you can use: `<player:%d>` or `<player:%s>`, which resolves to a slot number or player name, respectively.

All arguments defined in the `Vote:new()` constructor will be passed to callback functions (`vote`, `pass`, `fail`).

- `:description(string)`: help text of the command.

- `:vote(string | function)`: this can be either a string or function called immediately after `callvote` command. It's supposed to validate the arguments and return a vote string.

~~~lua
Vote:new("remove <player>")
    :vote("PUTSPEC <player:%s>") -- PUTSPEC ETPlayer
~~~

~~~lua
Vote:new("kill <player>")
    :vote(function(player)

        if math.random() < 0.5 then
            return false, "No, you're out of luck." -- you can optionally return error message
        end

        return string.format("KILL %s", et.gentity_get(player, "pers.netname"))
    
    end)
~~~

- `:pass(string | function)`: this will be called if the vote passes
  
- `:fail(string | function)`: this will be called if the vote fails

- `:percent(number)`: sets the percentage at which the vote passes, default: `vote_percent`

- `:team()`: makes the vote team only - this only works if the `<player>` argument is specified in the constructor

- `:attacker()`: makes the vote only available for attacking team

- `:defender()`: makes the vote only available for defending team

### Disabling vote commands

You can disable any or all the vote commands, including the built-in ones.

~~~lua
V.disable("*") -- disables all commands
V.disable("warmupdamage")
V.enable("kick")
~~~
